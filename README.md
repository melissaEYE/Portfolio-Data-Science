# Portfolio-Data-Science
This portfolio contains some of the projects I have worked on while completing my M.S. in Data Analytics at the University of Maryland. It showcases my experience using programs such as R, Python, SAS Enterprise Miner, SQL, and Tableau. Many of these projects highlight multiple skills needed by data scientists, such as problem identification, data exploration, data cleaning, data sampling, building predictive models, comparing models, data storytelling (communication), creating visualizations, and providing solutions to problems.

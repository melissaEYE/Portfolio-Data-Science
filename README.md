# Portfolio-Data-Science
This portfolio contains some of the projects I have worked on while completing my Masters in Data Analytics at the University of Maryland. It showcases my experience using programs such as R, Python, SAS Enterprise Miner, SQL, and Tableau. Many of these projects highlight multiple skills needed by data scientists, such as problem identification, data exploration, data cleaning, data sampling, building predictive models, comparing models, data storytelling (communication), creating visualizations, and providing data-driven solutions to problems.

## Cluster Analysis on Eye Tracking Data

https://github.com/melissaEYE/Cluster-Analysis


The objective of the analysis was to explore the variables that group together (cluster) to find similarities and relationships within the dataset. More specifically, using K-Means cluster analysis, an unsupervised learning method, to sort items into groups by similarity using eye tracking data and age.

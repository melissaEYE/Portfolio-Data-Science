# Portfolio-Data-Science
This portfolio contains some of the projects I have worked on while completing my Masters in Data Analytics at the University of Maryland. It showcases my experience using programs such as R, Python, SAS Enterprise Miner, SQL, and Tableau. Many of these projects highlight multiple skills needed by data scientists, such as problem identification, data exploration, data cleaning, data sampling, building predictive models, comparing models, data storytelling (communication), creating visualizations, and providing data-driven solutions to problems.

# Decisions First

Analytical requirements gathering using the Decisions First Modeler to frame the problem, provide a solution and communicate results.

# COGNOS Analytics

Exploratory Data Analysis: using COGNOS analytics. Visualizations of varying types are used to "tell the story" of the data. https://github.com/melissaEYE/Exploratory-Data-Analysis

##Predictive Modeling: 
The data set chosen for this assignment is the Billionaires data. Each model was created to predict the target variable, worth in billions. The goal in developing more than one model was to improve upon the predictive strength from model one to model four. https://github.com/melissaEYE/Predictive-Modeling-/blob/main/README.md

# R

## Cluster Analysis on Eye Tracking Data

https://github.com/melissaEYE/Cluster-Analysis


The objective of the analysis was to explore the variables that group together (cluster) to find similarities and relationships within the dataset. More specifically, using K-Means cluster analysis, an unsupervised learning method, to sort items into groups by similarity using eye tracking data and age. 


## Logistic Regression & Naive Bayesian Classification on AIDS Data

https://github.com/melissaEYE/Logistic-Regression-Naive-Bayesian-Classification

The objective of the analysis was to explore the factors that influence CD4 cell levels in the hope that doctors may to prescribe more effective treatments at different stages of the AIDS disease and perhaps better understand the disease trajectory and health care options. More specifically, using a binary logistic regression, was used to estimate the probability of an outcome of CD4 cells above and below a threshold of 50 cells per cubic millimeter (cells/mm3). Given the results of the logistical regression, a second analytical model, a Naive Bayesian Classification was used to estimate the class probability and specifically to determine if this model could improve, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.


## Conditional Inference Decision Tree (ctree) 

https://github.com/melissaEYE/Conditional-Inference-Tree

The objective of the analysis was to explore the factors that impact a woman’s choice of contraception method. The methods include no use of contraception, long-term methods, or short-term methods. More specifically, using a conditional inference tree (ctree) method of supervised learning, the objective is to categorize the choice of contraception method using input variables of demographic and socio-economic characteristics. Understanding what factors affect a woman’s contraceptive choice would be helpful information for the National Family Planning Program as they work to achieve the goals set out by the National Health System in Indonesia.


## Neural Networks and Diabetes

https://github.com/melissaEYE/R---Neural-Networks

The objective of the analysis was to explore the factors that impact a positive or negative diagnosis of diabetes. More specifically, using the Neural Networks (NN) method of supervised learning, the objective is to classify the diabetes diagnosis using various input variables to include health, demographics, and family history. Understanding what factors affect the Pima Indian female’s high incidence rate of diabetes may provide some insight into strategies for mitigation.


## Association Rules and Lung Cancer

https://github.com/melissaEYE/Association_Rules

The objective of the analysis was to determine co-morbid symptoms for patients who had lung cancer and were required to undergo a lung resection. Understanding which symptoms to be co-morbid can help to improve patient care and medicine prescription. The type of analysis is association rule learning, whereby associations, or sets of frequent items, between variables are explored to try and find insights and hidden relationships in large datasets (Han, Kamber, Pei, 2011). One example may be, that a person who smokes (lhs, antecedent), is frequently coupled with a symptom of cough and weakness (rhs, consequent).


## Text Classification (NLP) and Hotel Reviews

https://github.com/melissaEYE/Text-Classification

The objective of the analysis was to determine the sentiment (positive or negative) of patrons who stayed at the hotels. The type of analysis is text classification. The goal of text classification is to extract features within the unstructured patron reviews that represent the hotels, concepts such as "I like" or "I don't like...."

# SAS Enterprise Miner

## Bagging-Boosting-Random-Forest

https://github.com/melissaEYE/Bagging-Boosting-Random-Forest

The objective of the analysis was identify bad car buys for a second hand car sales business in order to help them avoid cars that were bad and develop an inventory of quality cars. Analysis was various ensemble decision tree models using SAS Enterprise Miner. 

## Heterogeneous-Ensemble-Models

https://github.com/melissaEYE/Heterogeneous-Ensemble-Models

The objective of the analysis was identify bad car buys for a second hand car sales business in order to help them avoid cars that were bad and develop an inventory of quality cars. Analysis included various ensemble Support Vector Machines (SVM), different forms of decision trees, regression, neural networks, and Naïve Bayesian models using SAS Enterprise Miner. 

## Support-Vector-Machines

 https://github.com/melissaEYE/Support-Vector-Machines
 
The objective of the analysis was identify bad car buys for a second hand car sales business in order to help them avoid cars that were bad and develop an inventory of quality cars. Analysis was conducted using various SVM parameters in SAS Enterprise Miner.

# Google Colab & Python 

## Deep-Learning-Convolutional-Neural-Networks

https://github.com/melissaEYE/Deep-Learning-Convolutional-Neural-Networks

The purpose of the analysis was to accurately identify objects in the images, such as a truck or car. To accomplish this purpose, a method of deep learning referred to as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), was employed.

# Reinforcement-Learning
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is one of three machine learning paradigms (supervised and unsupervised learning are the other two areas). In RL we are concerned with how "agents" or robots take actions within the environment.

## Tic-Tac-Toe

The purpose of the exercise is to create a model that learns how to play the game Tic-Tac-Toe. There are two versions of the game, the first, is a 3-x-3 matrix and the second is a 4-x-4 matrix. Original code is credited to Ryan Rudes (2020).

## Robot Factory Navigation 

The purpose of this assignment is to train a robot to navigate an environment (a guitar building factory) such that the robot moves through the factory in the most efficient manner to collect the required parts for building the guitar. To achieve this goal requires that the robot learn the factory layout (environment), the rooms or locations within the environment (states, n = 9) and how to navigate them (actions).
